# blockchain_addresses_list
The focus of this repo is to retrieve the full list of addresses ever appeared into blocks. These python scripts have been used for an academic research at Politecnico di Torino.

Repo is divided into different blockchains we've studied.
Every sub-directory contains a README that explains how the specific python script works.

Feel free to open issues, or to contribute to the project!
