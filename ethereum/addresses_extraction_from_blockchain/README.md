# Ethereum Addresses List(s)
The eth_addresses.py script will generate 12 *txt* files (named "eth_addresses_part#.txt") containing one address per row. If you don't change anything of the script, it will get addresses from block 0 to 14830178. **In order to get also the latest block (and so the latest addresses) you can simply change the last parameter of the thread at line 65 before running it.**
