# Blockchain(s) Address List Generation
## Introduction
The focus of this repo is to retrieve the full list of addresses ever appeared into any transactions of blockchains using secp256k1 curve. 
These Python scripts have been used for an academic research at Politecnico di Torino.

Repo is divided into different blockchains we've studied; more specifically, blockchains we've analyzed are: 
- Bitcoin 
- Ethereum
- Dogecoin
- Litecoin 
- Dash
- Zcash
- Bitcoin Cash

Every sub-directory contains a README that explains how the specific Python script works.

## Keys file generation 
In order to create the whole list of private and public keys for the subgroup we've chosen + its seven cosets, run the *KeysFileGeneration.py* script.
