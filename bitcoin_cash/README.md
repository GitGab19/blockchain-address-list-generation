# Bitcoin Cash Addresses List
In order to use this python script, you should have a registered account on Tatum (tatum.io) and copy your API access key into the script (line 12) before running it.

The bitcoin_cash_addresses.py script will generate a single *txt* file (named "bch_addresses_list.txt") containing one address per row. If you don't change anything of the script, it will get addresses from block 0 to 741389. **In order to get also the latest block (and so the latest addresses) you can simply change the *end_block* variable before running it.**
